I'm João Kling, currently pursuing a Master's in Economics at EPGE-FGV, following my Bachelor's in Economics from the University of São Paulo. My academic journey began with a fascination for monetary policy, intertwining my studies in macroeconomics and microeconomics, and igniting an interest in finance. I am driven by the endless potential of statistical and mathematical tools to unravel the complexities inherent in economic systems.

Beyond academia, my passion for Ancient Greek and Latin literature adds depth to my perspective, while hiking in the mountains provides solace and inspiration amidst the academic rigors.
