I'm João Kling, currently pursuing a Master's in Economics at EPGE-FGV, following my Bachelor's in Economics from the University of São Paulo. My academic journey began with a fascination for monetary policy, intertwining my studies in macroeconomics and microeconomics, and igniting an interest in finance. I am driven by the endless potential of statistical and mathematical tools to unravel the complexities inherent in economic systems.
