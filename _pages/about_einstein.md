I am João Kling, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Economics at EPGE-FGV, building upon my Bachelor's Degree in Economics from the University of São Paulo. My academic journey was sparked by a profound interest in monetary policy, which not only integrated my studies in macroeconomics and microeconomics but also ignited a keen enthusiasm for finance. Courses in statistics further equipped me with the analytical tools to explore the intricate impacts of government fiscal policies on economic fluctuations in my recent research. I am passionate about leveraging statistical and mathematical methodologies to unravel the complexities inherent in economic phenomena.

Beyond academia, my fascination with the Ancient Greek and Latin languages drives me to uncover timeless wisdom within classical texts. When I'm not immersed in economic theory, I indulge in the world of cinema, appreciating how films intricately portray human emotions and the complexities of existence. Furthermore, I find solace and adventure in the outdoors, particularly amidst the serene beauty of mountains during my hiking escapades.
